## About This Repo

This repository predominantly consists of three Python programs corresponding to different assignments for the Web Services and Applications module of the [HDip in Science in Computing in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics), ATU Galway. In addition to the Python programs, the repository contains a .gitignore file, a .txt file for testing purposes and a.json file which is output by one of the programs. A brief description of each file is provided under the 'Files Description' section.

## Files Description

- Assigment02-carddraw.py: Program that draws five cards from a single shuffled deck, printing the drawn cards and checking for a subset of poker hands.
- Assignment03-cso.py: Program that outputs historical exchequer account data from cso to file.
- Assignment04-githuby.py: Program that takes a file from a repo, replaces strings in that file, and then commits the updated file back to the repo

In addition:
- Andrew.txt is a test file that can be used to test the github.py file.
- cso.json is the output from Assignment03-cso.py
- .gitignore file is the [Python template](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore) from Git, with an additional line to ignore my local config.py file which contains my API keys (called on by Assignment04-github.py)

**Finbar Dennehy**

I'm currently undertaking the [HDip in Science in Computing in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics) on a part time basis at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/)

I have over ten years' experience in capital markets consultancy and have spent the past few years working on software delivery and customer success. I am undertaking this program to better understand our clients, who are predominantly data scientists and data engineers.
